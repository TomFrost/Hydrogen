/**
 * Router is the preferred method of matching URL requests to Controller
 * objects, making agressive use of caching to stay very quick, regardless of
 * the number or complexity of rules defined.  Many rules can be added to a
 * Router instance without incurring any extra processing or lookup time.
 *
 * Each "rule" in Router is simply a test to see if the request's URL
 * (specifically, the PATH_INFO) matches a specific pattern, and if so,
 * calling the appropriate Controller class and function to handle that
 * request.  Router rules can match all request types, or can be set to respond
 * only to DELETE, POST, PUT, or GET HTTP requests.
 *
 * The main goal of any routing rule is to end up with a variable named
 * 'controller' that defines which class should be loaded, and a variable
 * named 'function' that defines which function to call within the Controller
 * class.  This is a simple rule to direct requests to the root of the app
 * ('/') to the welcome Controller's greeting() function:
 *
 * <pre>
 * $router = new Router();
 * $router->request('/', array(
 *     'controller' => 'welcome',
 *     'function' => 'greeting'
 * ));
 * $router->start();
 * </pre>
 *
 * The supplied array of variables are the "defaults".  These can easily be
 * overridden by specifying that these variables should come from the URL:
 *
 * <pre>
 * $router->request('/:controller/:function');
 * </pre>
 *
 * The :variable format intercepts that specific piece of the request URL and
 * assigns it to the name of the variable.  In the example above, the Router
 * rule will match any URL with two path "segments" (like /welcome/greeting)
 * but ONLY if the specified controller and function actually exist.  If not,
 * Router will move on to the next rule.
 *
 * Parts of a URL can be made optional by putting them in parentheses.  The
 * following rule will match a direct request to the root, or allow the URL to
 * override the default controller and function:
 *
 * <pre>
 * $router->request('/(:controller(/:function))', array(
 *     'controller' => 'welcome',
 *     'function' => 'greeting'
 * ));
 * </pre>
 *
 * With the above rule, a request to /login would look for a Controller class
 * named 'login' and call its 'greeting' function.
 *
 * Consider, though, the liklihood that the controller classes are namespaced
 * and probably start with a capital first letter.  To achieve this, overrides
 * can be used.  Just as variables in URLs take precedence over the 'defaults'
 * array, overrides are applied before any controller function is called.
 *
 * <pre>
 * $router->request('/(:controller(/:function))', array(
 *     'controller' => 'welcome',
 *     'function' => 'greeting'
 * ), array(
 *     'controller' => '\myapp\controllers\%{controller|ucfirst}Controller'
 * ));
 * </pre>
 *
 * Using a second array of overrides, it's easy to transform a value of
 * 'welcome' for the controller into '\myapp\controllers\WelcomeController'.
 * In the array of overrides, existing variables can be referenced with
 * %variable or %{variable}.  Aditionally, it can be appended with a list of
 * pipe-separated filters to affect a change on the variable contents.  Legal
 * filters:
 *
 * - "ucfirst" makes the first letter uppercase
 * - "upper" makes the entire string uppercase
 * - "lower" will lowercase the entire string.
 *
 * Filters are executed in the order they are listed.  The following override
 * array will turn wELcOMe into Welcome:
 *
 * <pre>
 * array('controller' => '%{controller|lower|ucfirst});
 * </pre>
 *
 * Additional arguments aside from 'controller' and 'function' can also be
 * collected, and sent into the Controller's function as parameters.  The
 * following rule allows an optional "id" variable to be collected:
 *
 * <pre>
 * $router->request('/blog/:function(/:id)', array(
 *     'controller' => '\myapp\controllers\BlogController',
 *     'id' => 1
 * ));
 * </pre>
 *
 * With the above rule, if /blog/page/4 were requested, Router would call
 *
 * <pre>
 * \myapp\controllers\BlogController::page('4');
 * </pre>
 *
 * --assuming, of course, that BlogController contains a function called
 * 'page'.  Otherwise, Router would try any following rules.
 *
 * Groups of variables can also be captured by using the :*variable format.
 * Consider the following rule:
 *
 * <pre>
 * $router->request('/(:controller(/:function(/:*args)))', array(
 *     'controller' => 'home',
 *     'function' => 'index'
 * ), array(
 *     'controller' => '\myapp\controllers\%{controller|ucfirst}Controller',
 * ));
 * </pre>
 *
 * In the above case, if /blog/archive/2011/sept/10 is requested, Router would
 * make the following call:
 *
 * <pre>
 * \myapp\controllers\BlogController::archive("2011/sept/10");
 * </pre>
 *
 * It's unlikely that the argument would be useful without being separated into
 * each of its pieces, though, so Router provides two special overrides for
 * this case.  Overriding 'args' with <b>Router::EXPAND_ARRAY</b> would cause
 * this call to be made:
 *
 * <pre>
 * \myapp\controllers\BlogController::archive(array('2011', 'sept', '10'));
 * </pre>
 *
 * Or, override args with <b>Router::EXPAND_PARAMS</b> for this call:
 *
 * <pre>
 * \myapp\controllers\BlogController::archive('2011', 'sept', '10');
 * </pre>
 *
 * Router also allows each rule to specify a set of restrictions for each
 * variable in order for it to find a match, as well as controlling in which
 * order variables are sent to the function and whether or not all variables
 * are sent individually or passed in as a single associative array.  For
 * features not listed in this description, see the documentation for each
 * individual function.
